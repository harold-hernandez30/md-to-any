# Obsidian Vault Helper

## Purpose

Notes are dynamic. Which translate to difficult management. Notes never to be found again. Get insights into your abandoned notes.

- Help manage your Obsidian notes
- Generate reports
- Cleanup your empty notes
- Find similar tags
- Generate flashcards

## TODO

Create a MD parser such that we have an object we can ask the following from:

- Main topic - the highest level info, but the filename is usually the main topic with the next level being an Overview
- Metadata - information to help with searchability, and categories
- Sub topics - can be as deep as h7
- Identify notes that have headings but have no content or sub headings
